# Magic-Books Inc

This project is about creating a very simple React and Redux application. Working on a real world project for a fictitious company that requires help. They have requested help to build the front-end of an application that will help them organize and manage their bookstore. They want it to be fast, dynamic, and responsive to their actions. The project has been split into several milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that were implemented.
